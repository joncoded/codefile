# 🏡 Introduction

An attempt to gather **web development** notes into one notebook!

{% hint style="info" %}
Any topic marked with the 🚧 \(under construction emoji\) still requires finishing at a later date!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
This project remains an ongoing work-in-progress, likely never to finish, as hundreds of topics in web development come and go! 
{% endhint %}

### **Contexts**

This section will cover **web development** to complement the above mentioned programming concepts**:** 

{% page-ref page="web-development/html/" %}

{% page-ref page="web-development/css/" %}

{% page-ref page="web-development/javascript/" %}

{% page-ref page="web-development/next.js/" %}

{% page-ref page="web-development/react/" %}

{% page-ref page="web-development/git/accessibility/" %}

{% page-ref page="web-development/git/" %}

{% page-ref page="web-development/tutorials/" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Using [**Gitbook**](https://www.gitbook.com) since this platform has:

* a free hosting tier
* a responsive design that includes
  * fast searching
  * complex sidebar \(or hamburger menu\) navigation
  * website-like interface that departs from the "blog look"
  * navigation of previous and next pages
* an allowance for readers to suggest changes via GitHub
* integration with GitHub so this site will live on forever!
