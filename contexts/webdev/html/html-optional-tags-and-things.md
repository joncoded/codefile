description: good-to-know but not essential tags of HTML

# 🚧 HTML \(optional content\)

### Monospaced text

`<code>` looks exactly like what it says but, more specifically, it displays text where each character has the same horizontal width

### Embedded external content

`<iframe>` displays content from external sites in a frame: 

* the frame can be "made responsive" by having a width of 100%
* they should be used very sparingly
