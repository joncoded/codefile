# HTML &lt;meta&gt;

A well-developed page typically has about a dozen of these self-closing tags for search engine \(SEO\) and social media optimization \(SMO?\) purposes, the most important of which are:

### description

* the description of the web page

```markup
<meta name="description" content="A page that shows you how to use meta tags">
```

### keywords

* basically a description in terms of single words or phrases

```markup
<meta name="keywords" content="meta tags, html, web development">
```

### viewport

* more relevant in recent times, this makes the page more readable in mobile phone screens

```markup
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
