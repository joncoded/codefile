# Git terms

Git has quite some jargon that make it seem unapproachable at first...

...but as soon as you realize that they consist of just synonyms of common computing terms, you should be fine!

| Term | Laymen's term |
| :--- | :--- |
| **repository**  \(aka **repo**\) | project folder |
| **local repository**  \(aka **local**\) | project folder on a personal computer |
| **remote repository**  \(aka **remote**\) | project folder on the Internet \(a server, perhaps?\) |
| **staging** | a selection of files from the project folder |
| **committing** | confirming the selection of files as a change to the project |
| **pushing** | uploading the confirmations to the project folder on the Internet |
| **cloning** | copying a project folder from the Internet to one's computer |
| **forking** | copying someone else's project from the Internet onto one's own account |
| **branching** | creating a parallel version of a project \(which can later merge back\) |
| **checkout** | setting a branch as the current working branch |
| **merging** | combining a version with another version of a project |
