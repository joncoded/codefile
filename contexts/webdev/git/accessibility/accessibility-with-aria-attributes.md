# Accessibility with ARIA attributes

**ARIA attributes** provide additional information to HTML elements that help a screen reader user determine the state of that element:

* `aria-label` provides more or clarified information next to a paragraph
* `aria-expanded` informs the state of a collapsible element: 
  * opened or expanded \(`true`\) 
  * closed or collapsed \(`false`\)
