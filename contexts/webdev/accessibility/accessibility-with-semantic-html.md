# Accessibility with semantic HTML

When we organize a page with [semantic HTML](../html/semantic-html/), as opposed to just `<div>` elements with `id` attributes, we can allow assistive technologies to summarize the page better, for example: 

* `<div id="nav">` becomes `<nav>` 
* `<div id="header">` becomes `<header>`
* `<div id="footer">` becomes `<footer>`

Since assistive technologies will more likely let the user know the purpose of a semantic tag rather than a `<div>`, using semantic HTML gives the page more organization!
