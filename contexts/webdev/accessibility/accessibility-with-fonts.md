# Accessibility with fonts

General rules with HTML text - ensure: 

* color contrast 
  * don't use yellow text on a white background
* appropriate font sizing
  * don't use a tiny font size
  * ensure differentiation in sizes for the [heading hierarchy](accessibility-with-hierarchies.md#heading-hierarchies)
    * `<h1>` should get largest font size
    * an `<h2>` should not have a smaller font size than, say, an `<h3>` or `<h4>`
* \`\`
